                    Humans have been cooking meat for at<br> least 250,000 years, according to estimates.<br>
                     Cooking meat breaks down any tough fibers <br>and connective tissue, which makes<br>
                      it easier to chew and digest. It also <br>leads to better nutrient absorption.<br>
